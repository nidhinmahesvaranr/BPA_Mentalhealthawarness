                                        <h3>Anxiety Disorder</h3>
                                        <p><b>Overview :</b><br>
                                        Anxiety disorder is a mental health condition that leads to excessive fear or worry in everyday situations. While feeling anxious can be normal, it becomes a disorder when it happens too often or at the wrong times. Anxiety disorders can change a person's life and make normal activities harder. <br> <br>
                                        <img src="IMG/Anxiety.jpg" align="right" alt="Anxiety" style="width:200px;height:150px;"><br> <br>
                                        <b>Symptoms :</b><br>
                                        Symptoms may include shortness of breath, dizziness, sweating, and a rapid heartbeat. Anxiety can also lead to panic attacks and may contribute to substance use or depression. <br> <br>
                                        <b>Contributing Factors :</b><br>
                                        Factors include environmental stress or trauma, genetics, physical or medical conditions, medication, or drug use. <br>
                                        Diagnosis and Treatment <br> Anxiety may be diagnosed when symptoms are distressing, interfere with daily activities, or are long-lasting or recurring. Treatment options include education, relaxation techniques, therapy, and medication. <br> <br>
                                        <b>Self-Care :</b> <br>
                                        Self-care focuses on creating feelings of safety and control while reducing background stress. Helpful strategies include cutting out caffeine, practicing mindfulness, using breathing exercises, and establishing calming daily routines.<br></p>

                                        <h3>ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder)</h3>
                                        <p><b>Overview :</b><br>
                                        ADHD is a brain developmental disorder that impacts many areas of daily life. <br> <br>
                                        <b>Symptoms :</b> <br>
                                        ADHD affects a person's ability to stay on task, sit still, and control impulsive behavior. Symptoms may include daydreaming, forgetfulness, trouble finishing tasks, hyperactivity, irritability, and frequently losing items. <br> <br>
                                        <b>Contributing Factors :</b><br>
                                        ADHD cannot be prevented and often runs in families. Factors may include premature birth, low birth weight, maternal drug use during pregnancy, or prolonged prenatal stress. <br> <br>
                                        <b>Diagnosis and Treatment :</b><br>
                                        Diagnosis is made by qualified healthcare professionals using medical and psychological information. Medications work well for many people with ADHD. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and coaching for organization and time management can also help with daily activities. <br> <br>
                                        <b>Self-Care :</b><br>
                                        Using planners or timers, maintaining a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and getting proper sleep can support managing symptoms.</p>

                                                <h3>Autism Spectrum Disorder</h3>
                                        <p><b>Overview :</b><br>
                                        Autism is a developmental disorder that affects communication and social skills. <br> <br>
                                        <b>Symptoms :</b><br>
                                        Individuals may have trouble understanding social cues, sensory sensitivities or sensory-seeking behaviors, repetitive behaviors or interests, and challenges with managing emotions. The severity and type of challenges vary, which is why it is considered a spectrum disorder. <br> <br>
                                        <b>Contributing Factors :</b><br>
                                        Autism cannot be prevented and often runs in families. Differences in brain development are also linked to autism. <br> <br>
                                        <b>Diagnosis and Treatment :</b><br>
                                        Diagnosis is based on developmental and behavioral history and is often identified in childhood. There is no cure; therapy aims to improve quality of life instead of curing the condition. <br> <br>
                                        <b>Self-Care :</b><br>
                                        Helpful strategies include structured schedules, sensory accommodations like headphones or specific clothing, rest breaks, and access to personal space.</p>

                                        <h3>Bipolar Disorder</h3>
                                        <p><b>Overview :</b><br></p>
                                        Bipolar disorder is a long-term mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings between depressive and manic or hypomanic episodes. Many individuals can live stable lives with the right support. <br> <br>
                                        <b>Symptoms :</b><br>
                                        Depressive episodes may include sadness, emptiness, hopelessness, fatigue, trouble focusing, and changes in sleep or appetite. Manic episodes may involve extreme energy, little need for sleep, racing thoughts, impulsive actions, and risk-taking behavior. Hypomania presents similarly but is less severe. <br> <br>
                                        <b>Contributing Factors :</b><br>
                                        Bipolar disorder is not preventable and is often genetically linked. External stressors do not cause the disorder.  <br> <br>
                                        <b>Diagnosis and Treatment :</b><br>
                                        Diagnosis involves assessing symptoms, episode patterns, and ruling out other causes. Treatment usually includes mood-stabilizing medications and therapy to help manage symptoms and stress. <br> <br>
                                        <b>Self-Care :</b><br>
                                        Maintaining a consistent sleep routine, tracking mood changes, and creating daily stability are essential for managing bipolar disorder.</p>

                                        <h3>Depression</h3>
                                        <p><b>Overview :</b>
                                        Depression is marked by ongoing sadness and an inability to enjoy activities. It affects daily functioning, relationships, school, and work. It can impact anyone and often develops after severe trauma or major life stressors. Approximately 4% of the global population experiences depression, which has a strong link to suicide. Despite its prevalence, only about one-third of individuals in high-income countries receive treatment, often due to stigma, financial barriers, or limited access to care. <br> <br>
                                        <b>Symptoms :</b> <br>
                                        A depressive episode lasts at least two weeks and may include a low mood, loss of interest, low energy, trouble focusing, changes in sleep or appetite, guilt, hopelessness, and thoughts of self-harm. Depression can range from mild to severe and may occur alongside other mood disorders. <br> <br>
                                        <b>Contributing Factors :</b> <br>
                                        Depression is influenced by social and biological factors. It increases stress, which can worsen life circumstances and overall health. Preventive efforts include teaching coping skills, providing family support, and encouraging physical activity. <br> <br>
                                        <b>Diagnosis and Treatment :</b> <br>
                                        Psychological therapies such as CBT, Behavioral Activation, Interpersonal Therapy, and Problem-Solving Therapy are commonly used. Medication is typically reserved for moderate to severe cases and is not recommended for children. <br> <br>
                                        <b>Self-Care :</b> <br>
                                        Staying connected with others, maintaining routines, exercising, avoiding substances, and seeking professional help are important steps. If someone has suicidal thoughts, immediate support from trusted individuals, healthcare providers, or emergency services is critical.</p>

                                        <p><b>Overview :</b> <br> 
                                        Disruptive behavior and dissocial disorders affected millions of children and adolescents in 2021. These disorders involve persistent behavioral issues, including defiance and repeated violations of social norms. Symptoms often start in childhood. <br> <br>
                                        <b>Treatment and Support :</b> <br> 
                                        Effective treatment often involves parents, caregivers, and educators, and may include cognitive problem-solving and social skills training. <br></p>

                                        Schizophrenia impacts a person's perception of reality, thought processes, behavior, and emotions. Symptoms may include hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, reduced emotional expression, social withdrawal, and cognitive difficulties with attention, memory, and problem-solving. While two-thirds experience recurring or worsening episodes, about 33% achieve full remission. <br> <br>
                                        <b>Diagnosis and Treatment :</b> <br> 
                                        Many individuals with schizophrenia do not receive adequate treatment. According to the World Health Organization, expanding community-based mental health care is essential. Effective care includes integration into primary health services, community mental health centers, supported housing, outreach services, and active family and community involvement.</p>

                                        <h3>Leveraging our Communities for Latinx Mental Health-Addressing Anxiety, Depression & Trauma:</h3><p>It will take more than one solution to help improve the mental health of the Latinx population. Many individuals face financial issues, cultural challenges, and a lack of knowledge when it comes to the aspects of mental health. Reaching out to these individuals through groups and churches could make them more comfortable in seeking help. Different solutions are also available on how individuals can be healed, and these options will help open doors when it comes to treatment. <br> <br>
                                Mental health is a crucial part of Latinx individuals because this population continues to grow, especially with unique issues. Sadness, anxiety, and stress affect Latinx people more commonly than other people. Even though this is happening, people aren't considering this problem. <br> <br>
                                It has been evident that many Latinxs require help but aren't receiving it. Respect for the culture in seeking help is steadily gaining prominence due to the growth in this community. <br> 
                                Some of the key problems at stake include imbalanced treatment and lack of access. It is important, therefore,e to recognize that one of the main goals for administrators should be to help the Latinx population by informing them about mental issues. It would be important for this to eliminate the stigma of help and would be a key component in shortening the gap with regard to both met and unmet needs.</p>

                                <h3>People Need Help, Not Handcuffs: Mental Illness and the Criminal Justice System</h3><p>People who have illnesses are in jails and prisons a lot. Two million people with mental illness get booked every year. In the month of March, we have National Criminal Justice Month to talk about this problem. The story of Kimberly Comer shows what happens when people with illnesses don't get the help they need. She went to jail because she had bipolar disorder. Being alone in her cell made her symptoms worse. <br> <br>
                                Now Kimberly Comer is an advocate and a certified peer specialist. According to her, it's essential to enhance our knowledge of the sickness and offer support to those who suffer from it. The case of mental illness is a critical one, and the likes of Kimberly Comer are struggling to bring the light of hope to the area of mental illness. NAMI supports the idea of directing individuals with mental health disorders away from the judicial system, increasing access to early intervention, and providing mental health care in the community as a means of reducing the number of people in jails.</p>

                        <div class="card"><h3>Neuroplasticity III : Trusting Myself after Psychosis & Jail</h3><p>Several months after her release from custody, she discovered charges of three misdemeanors and 14 felonies against her, which threatened to imprison her for four to five years or send her to a forensic hospital. After two decades of being a forensic psychiatrist, she was shocked and disappointed at how her life had turned out and was unable to clearly explain her reasoning to defend herself because of her intellectual disabilities. The cornerstone of her defense was that a person has to be able to form a guilty intention, which was affected by her serious illness. Surrounded by her isolation and loss of confidence, and even due to mistaken beliefs in the judicial system, she finally realized how crucial it is to develop self-confidence from within and not from outside. She regained confidence through arranging care and gaining insights into neuroplasticity, and ended up having charges against her dropped.</p></div>

                                        <p><b>AI-Powered Journaling for College Students: MindScape :</b><br>  
                                        MindScape is doing something to help college students with their mental health. It uses a computer program to look at what students write in their journals and what they do every day. The MindScape app looks at things like how students talk to people, how much they sleep, and where they go. It uses this information and special computer models called Large Language Models to give students a journaling experience that is just for them. <br>
                                        This helps students understand themselves better and feel better overall. MindScape is really about helping college students with their mental health by using this new approach. <br> <br>
                                        <b>Study Overview :</b><br> 
                                        A study was conducted with 20 college students over 8 weeks to see how well MindScape works. The results showed clear improvements in students' mental health. <br> 
                                        Positive feelings increased by 7% <br> 
                                        Negative feelings decreased by 11% <br> 
                                        Feelings of loneliness decreased by 6% <br> 
                                        Symptoms of anxiety and depression improved <br>
                                        PHQ-4 scores dropped by 0.25 per week, showing reduced anxiety and depression <br> Mindfulness increased by 7% <br> <br>
                                        <b>Why It Works :</b> <br>
                                        Students liked the questions and ideas that the AI came up with. These questions were different from traditional journal prompts and felt more personal. The AI uses information about what people do every day to make journaling more interesting and relevant. <br>
                                        This contextual AI journaling helps people think about what they do and how they feel in a more personal way. Many students felt the experience was like talking to someone who understands them. <br> <br> 
                                        <b>Key Insight :</b> <br> 
                                        The app combines conversational patterns, sleep, and location data with language learning models to increase self-awareness. Feedback from participants shows that using AI to support journaling and make it context-aware can be helpful for students on college campuses.<br>
                                        AI-driven journaling can make a real difference and may be a useful mental health tool for colleges.</p>

                        <div class="card"><h3>Healthcare Undergraduates</h3><p>Undergraduate students pursuing higher education in the healthcare industry can face many mental health issues. This study explores the challenges that the mental health of undergraduate students in the healthcare industry faces. <br> <br>
                                <b>Target Population :</b> <br> 
                                The target audience of this research is undergraduate university-level students pursuing a degree in a healthcare-related field. These students are most likely to experience feelings of isolation and stigma when it comes to conversations about mental health in academic and clinical environments. <br>
                                Because they are expected to perform well academically and in clinical settings, there is a need to explore how supportive environments can be created. Many students experience pressure related to self-expectations, clinical responsibilities, and academic demands. <br> <br>
                                <b>Coping and Support Systems :</b> <br>
                                Some common coping measures involve social networks, but the study notes that institutional support is often more effective. This research uses qualitative approaches, such as interviews, to better understand students' personal experiences and challenges. <br> <br>
                                <b>Key Insights :</b> <br>
                                The deeper meaning of this study highlights the need to address mental health not only for patients, but specifically for medical students themselves. Reducing stigma within academic institutions is essential for promoting open discussions about mental health. <br>
                                The involvement of mental health education in medical training could have a strong positive impact on student well-being and professional development. <br> <br>
                                <b>Study Limitations and Takeaway :</b> <br>
                                While the study identifies important mental health challenges, it does not include specific sample characteristics or detailed qualitative or quantitative data. It also does not provide clear recommendations for policy or program improvements. <br>
                                However, the study emphasizes the importance of mental health considerations and draws attention to the need to develop future healthcare professionals with strong mental resilience and emotional strength.</p>
